# CASIO-OR-4
Schematices, design files &amp; everything I have on revercse engineering efforts on the CASIO OR-4 4-BIT 4KB RAM module. If any of you guys can contrubute to this then go ahead, for example using a more modern RAM chip.

I intend to have these as Open Source projects so the comunity can edit & improve the design files. I am hopeing we can find a way to use modern RAM chips so we can truyely make repoductions of these RAM cards as original ones are hard to find & exspnsive.
